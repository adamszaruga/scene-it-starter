### bug
1. not calling saveToAdd function
https://codepen.io/heggy231/pen/jOypQqp

### improvment
- [x] Redesign the application to your own aesthetic
- [] Some movies that come back from the API don’t have image urls. Maybe add a default “no image found” image for those movies!
- [] Allow users to rate and/or review movies that are on their watchlist
- [] Let users click on movies to show more details about the movie (rotten tomatoes rating, synopsis, etc.)

### handy note:
#### styling:
